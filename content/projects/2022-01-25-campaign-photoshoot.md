title: Campaign Photoshoot
short_description: A twist to traditions because coffee can be fun.
long_description: "Fun is what you make it and you can drink coffee however you
  want! For it's first campaign the concept was based around fun through the
  different ways of drinking coffee in order to showcase that we bright colors
  and one of the brand's signature colors: red, to show power and create
  contrast with fun and softer but full of personality colors like yellow and
  hot pink."
